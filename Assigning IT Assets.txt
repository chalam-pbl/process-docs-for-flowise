Step 1. If the asset is a desktop, it will be assigned directly to the user, and the details will be recorded in the shared drive ("IT Deprt Santosh List") by the system admin.
Step 2. If the asset is a laptop, dongle, UPS, or any other site-specific asset, it will be assigned accordingly. The system admin will then share the asset details with the HR department via email for tagging the asset to the respective employee on PLUM.
Step 3. Once the information is received, asset tagging will be completed by HR. 
	Notes:	a) All tagged assets, along with the respective employee details, are maintained in a centralized dashboard for tracking and reference. 
		b) This information can be viewed in Dashboard No. 74.
