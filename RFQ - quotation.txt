Quotation (RFQ)


Step 1:
Upon receiving an enquiry, the Sales or Account Executive creates an Opportunity in PLUM.

Step 2:
If the enquiry is from a new customer, background verification is performed, and approval is obtained from the Managing Director (MD) for new business limits—specifically for transport-related credit limit approvals through shared drive "Probe42 drive".
Only upon MD’s approval, quotations are shared with the customer; otherwise, they are withheld.

Step 3:
If the enquiry is received through existing lead, an Opportunity Header is created in the Leads submodule, and Opportunity Lines are created in the Opportunity submodule in PLUM.

Step 4:
For direct enquiries from customers we've previously worked with or have previously quoted, both the Opportunity Header and Lines are created directly within the Opportunity submodule in PLUM.
If necessary, vendor registration is completed on the customer’s portal by the Sales or Account Executive.

Step 5:
If additional information is needed, the Sales/Account Executive contacts the customer for clarification regarding the RFQ. In cases involving sister concerns or subsidiaries, confirmation of the correct GST Number is obtained before proceeding with quotation submission.

Step 6:
After the opportunity is created, market rates are collected from suppliers or fleet owners via calls and WhatsApp. Once the market rate is finalized, the Operating Executive (OE) updates the Market Rate in PLUM.

Step 7:
A profit margin is added after discussion with the management. Following this, a Rate Finalization Entry is recorded in PLUM, and a formal Quotation is created under the Opportunity

Step 8:
The quotation is approved in PLUM based on the value:

For values ≤ ₹5,00,000: Self-approval. For values > ₹5,00,000: Approval by Senior sales manager 

Step 9:
After approval, the Quotation is sent to the customer. The Sales/Account Executive follows up with a phone call/mail to the customer for the status of the quotation.

Step 10:
If negotiation is required, a revised quote is created using the same steps from Rate Finalization to Quotation sending to the customer.

Step 11:
Once the quotation result is known, update the Sales Quotation Status in PLUM accordingly:

Win: Check if the customer exists in Customer Masters All submodule under masters in PLUM. If available, pick the customer and update status to Win. If not available, create the Customer Master Entry, then update status to Win

Lost:Change status to Lost with appropriate remarks in PLUM. If the quotation is being revised, update status as Revised (no customer check needed in Masters for lost and revised status)
